# Shadcn AI Personal Finance Dashboard
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This project utilizes `Plaid` and `OpenAI` technologies as well as `shadcn` to unlock insights into your spending and transactions. Simply clone and deploy with your own Plaid Developer API Key to host a private Mint App clone, boosted with `Vercel AI SDK` & `Generative UI`. Take it forward, contribute or commercialize - go nuts.
